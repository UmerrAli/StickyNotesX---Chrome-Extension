StickyNotesX is a Chrome extension that allows users to easily annotate any web page with sticky notes. With this tool, you can add, edit, and delete notes, choose from three color options, and manage all your notes from a central popup page. Each note is saved along with the URL of the web page, so you can easily revisit pages with your annotations
